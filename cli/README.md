# DjangoKit CLI

This package provides the DjangoKit command line interface. When it's
installed, it will install the `djangokit` console script.

To see a list of commands, run `djangokit` without any arguments (or use
the `dk` alias as shown here):

To run a Django management command:

    dk manage <args>
