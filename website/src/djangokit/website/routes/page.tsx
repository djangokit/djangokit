      <p className="lead">DjangoKit is full stack meta-framework for Django.</p>

      <p>
        It&apos;s similar in spirit to frameworks such as Next.js, Remix, and
        SvelteKit with the most obvious difference being that your back end code
        is written in Python/Django rather than in JavaScript/Node.
