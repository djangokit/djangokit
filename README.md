# DjangoKit

DjangoKit is an opinionated meta-framework for creating full stack
Django apps in a manner similar to Next.js, Remix, and SvelteKit.

As with these frameworks, DjangoKit has the goal of helping you get
sites up and running quickly with minimal mucking about with setup and
configuration.

## Why / Features

- Allows the Python ecosystem to be leveraged in back end code where,
  IMO, it shines
- Makes it easy to set up a Django project using modern tools and code
  layout
- Makes it easy to create a page-oriented site with filesystem routing 
  while also allowing you to use the full power of Django as needed
- Makes it easy to integrate a React front end into a Django project
- Provides a project template (via `cookiecutter`) and scaffolding
  commands to add new models, routes, etc.
- Supports Python 3.7+
- Supports Node 14+ (TODO: Decide on minimum supported Node version)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use the
[DjangoKit Cookiecutter](cookiecutter).
